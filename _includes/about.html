                <h2>About $30 wind turbine</h2>
                <p>Works in winds from 15-100km/h (we've tested it on the back of a holden commodore). The only materials you need for this is some old aluminium printing plates, a bike wheel, and some rivets.  You really need to write this yourself</p>
                <p>The whole thing takes about 4 hours to put together with just a ruler, a box-cutter, a drill, and a rivet-gun.</p>
